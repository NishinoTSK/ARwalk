It is an internal navigation tool using an augmented reality interface with a focus on people with down syndrome, however it can be used by any type of person.

To install the application on your phone, just download the .apk file in Android Application and install it on a smartphone with the android operating system.

The Markers folder contains the images used to identify the positions within the internal environment and the Password to Configuration file is the password to be able to enter the configuration screen within the application.

In test files are the files that were used for testing. To load in the application just download the .txt file and put it in the following folder:

If it is android:
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.Personal.ARwalk/files

If it is IOS:
/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<guid>/Documents

Finally in the application just type the name of the file without the .txt as for example House.txt would be House.

Finally, to make modifications to the application it is necessary to download the unityhub and add the folder "Unity Project" and make the necessary installations of the version after that it is already possible to modify the code.
